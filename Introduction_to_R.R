#in this, the probabilistic models, the statistical works, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, R is fundamental tool for that
#R is an interpreted language (like Java) and not compiled (like C,
#C++, Fortran, Pascal, . . . ), which means that commands typed on the keyboard are executed
#directly without the need to build executables.
#Let´S to begin

#R prompts you with ">", on the console. Imagine. R is like a big calculator, enter your expression, 
#and R will evaluate the expression and evaluate the result
#Example:
